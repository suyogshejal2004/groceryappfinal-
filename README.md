# 🛒 Grocery App Backend

This is a **Node.js + Fastify** backend for a Grocery App.  
It includes:
- ✅ MongoDB (via Mongoose)
- ✅ Fastify as the server
- ✅ Socket.IO for real‑time updates
- ✅ AdminJS dashboard (`/admin`)
- ✅ Seed script to populate initial `categories` and `products`

---

## 📦 Requirements
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB Atlas or local MongoDB instance
- npm or yarn

---

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/grocery-app-backend.git
cd grocery-app-backend
````

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your MongoDB URI:

```env
MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
